Jake: Good morning everyone, thanks for joining. Let's start with introductions.

John: Morning, John Brown here, representing the contractor.

Sarah: Sarah Williams, client side.

Jake: Great. Mike sends his apologies, he's on another site today.

Moving on to the monthly progress report. We're currently at Report No. 15. The main works are progressing well, we're about 60% complete overall.

Sarah: What about the health and safety review?

Jake: All good, no incidents this month. The site safety officer has completed the monthly inspection.

John: On the construction programme, we're slightly ahead on Section 1 but Section 2 is running about a week behind due to the weather delays last month.

Sarah: Any design matters to discuss?

Jake: Yes, we need the updated structural drawings for the foundation work. John, can you send those over by Friday 21/06/2025?

John: Will do, I'll have them ready by Thursday.

Jake: Perfect. Now on contract dates - contract commencement was 01/07/2024. Section 1 completion is scheduled for 15/12/2024, Section 2 for 28/02/2025, and Section 3 for 15/05/2025. Practical completion target is 30/06/2025.

That wraps up the main items. Any other business?

Sarah: No, that's all from me.

Jake: Thanks everyone, see you next month.
